This is currently a basic JavaScript-based fractal renderer.  It requires Canvas support.

The code is structured in a way that new it should be easy to add support for different types of fractals.

Work items:
-Improve performance(there are some easy optimizations available on Wikipedia(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Optimizations)
-Stop current rendering when a click event occurs
-Currently, every pixel is drawn to the canvas separately.  Drawing actually takes a significant amount of time(in seconds).  Drawing continuous regions of color in a single operation could improve performance
-See if HTML5 Worker Threads can be put to use
